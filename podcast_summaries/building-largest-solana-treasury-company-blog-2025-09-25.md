## Introduction

In a comprehensive discussion with 0xResearch, Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin Capital, details the groundbreaking $1.65 billion raise for Forward Industries—the largest Solana treasury company ever created. This isn't just another crypto DAT (Digital Asset Treasury); it represents a fundamental experiment in running a publicly traded company entirely on-chain while pioneering new financial structures that could reshape how businesses operate in the digital economy.

## Key Insights

### 1. The On-Chain Business Revolution

Samani's most ambitious vision involves transitioning Forward Industries to operate as the world's first fully on-chain publicly traded company. This goes far beyond simply holding crypto assets—they plan to conduct payroll, vendor payments, equity issuance, dividends, stock splits, and even shareholder governance votes entirely on Solana.

> "We are going to transition running as much of the business as we can on chain and that'll be both for core operations... as well as for capital markets functions... We're going to do all of that natively on chain."

This represents a massive experiment that could prove to traditional markets that any company can operate with blockchain-native infrastructure. As Samani notes, "someone has to be the guinea pig and just do all of the weird stuff."

### 2. The Yield Advantage: Why Solana DATs Beat Bitcoin DATs

Unlike MicroStrategy's Bitcoin treasury strategy, Forward Industries can generate actual cash flow to service debt through two mechanisms: native Solana staking yield (approximately 8%) and DeFi arbitrage opportunities. This creates a compelling case for perpetual preferred securities.

> "The problem for Sailor is that he has no yield like he has no organic profits to pay down the coupons. I can go to you and show you where my profits are coming from."

Samani believes this yield-generating capability could actually allow Forward Industries to secure better financing terms than MicroStrategy, despite Solana being a smaller, less liquid asset than Bitcoin.

### 3. The Dream Team Structure and M&A Strategy

The partnership between Multicoin, Jump, and Galaxy creates unique competitive advantages:
- **Galaxy**: Client relationships, asset management, and M&A expertise
- **Jump**: Fire Dancer node infrastructure and proprietary HFT technology
- **Multicoin**: Deep Solana ecosystem relationships and public advocacy

The three-way split creates a platform for aggressive M&A activity, with Samani predicting massive DAT consolidation across ecosystems. His contrarian view: smaller ecosystem DATs (like those on Avalanche or Sui) will struggle most, not the #7 or #8 players in major ecosystems.

### 4. Internet Capital Markets: The Coming Infrastructure Revolution

Samani's broader vision involves embedding financial markets directly into everyday software. Rather than requiring users to visit dedicated trading apps, financial functionality becomes native to all digital experiences.

> "You've never embedded trading in the rest of the software... crypto breaks down this barrier. This is the definition of permissionless access."

He envisions prediction markets embedded in news articles, sports betting integrated into TV broadcasts, and trading functionality built into group chats—all powered by programmable blockchain infrastructure.

## Actionable Takeaways

### For Investors and Builders
1. **Focus on Infrastructure, Not Features**: The real opportunity lies in building the underlying systems that enable on-chain business operations, not just trading interfaces. Think payroll systems, corporate governance tools, and compliance infrastructure.

2. **Yield-Generating Assets Win**: In a world of perpetual preferred securities and credit arbitrage, assets that generate native yield (like staking) provide structural advantages over store-of-value assets without cash flow.

3. **Ecosystem Maturity Matters**: Samani's analysis suggests that DATs in smaller ecosystems will struggle due to insufficient liquidity, service providers, and lending infrastructure. The network effects of mature ecosystems like Solana create compounding advantages.

### For Understanding Market Dynamics
1. **DAT Consolidation is Inevitable**: The market won't sustain 20+ treasury companies. Look for acquisition opportunities as smaller players trade below NAV and struggle to justify their existence.

2. **Regulatory Momentum is Critical**: The GENIUS Act represents a generational shift for stablecoins. Similar legislative clarity could accelerate other crypto use cases by decades.

3. **Mobile Integration is the Catalyst**: When iOS and Android natively implement stablecoin functionality, Samani predicts it will trigger "the single largest capital shift in human history" by giving 7 billion people dollar wallets in their phones.

### For Strategic Planning
1. **Scale Enables Better Deals**: Forward Industries' $1.65B size allows them to negotiate preferential terms with protocols, access institutional lending, and command attention from traditional finance partners.

2. **Transparency as Competitive Advantage**: Samani plans to eventually publish all of Forward's on-chain addresses, enabling real-time dashboard tracking—a level of transparency impossible in traditional finance.

3. **Cross-Ecosystem Arbitrage**: The ability to leverage both traditional credit markets and DeFi yields creates sustainable profit margins that pure crypto or pure TradFi players cannot access.

## Conclusion: Building the Financial Operating System of the Future

Forward Industries represents more than a large treasury play—it's an experiment in creating the foundational infrastructure for internet-native capital markets. By proving that a publicly traded company can operate entirely on-chain while generating superior returns, Samani and his partners are building the template for how business will function in a digital-first economy.

The implications extend far beyond Solana or even crypto. If successful, Forward Industries will demonstrate that programmable, permissionless financial infrastructure can deliver better outcomes than traditional systems built on century-old regulatory frameworks. This isn't just about number go up—it's about rebuilding the fundamental architecture of how capital flows, how businesses operate, and how global finance functions.

The convergence of regulatory clarity (GENIUS Act), technological maturity (Solana's infrastructure), and institutional capital ($1.65B raise) creates a unique moment where these experiments become possible at scale. Whether Forward Industries succeeds or fails, it represents a critical test case for the entire thesis that crypto can replace, not just augment, traditional financial infrastructure.

As Samani concludes: "We're building a new financial system from the ground up here... our ability to do things moves the needle in the long-term success of the ecosystem as a whole." The next few years will determine whether this vision becomes the new standard for how companies operate in the digital age.
