# iPhone 17 Series First Impressions: The Air Changes Everything

*Based on MKBHD's unboxing and early testing*

The iPhone 17 series has arrived, and Marques Brownlee's latest unboxing reveals some fascinating shifts in Apple's smartphone strategy. While the Pro models receive predictable upgrades, it's the ultra-thin iPhone Air and the surprisingly compelling base model that steal the show in this year's lineup.

## The iPhone Air: Engineering Marvel with Real-World Questions

The most striking device in Apple's 2025 lineup is undoubtedly the iPhone Air - so thin that Apple packages it sideways in the box. Brownlee's hands-on experience reveals both the marvel and the compromises of this engineering feat.

**"Every time you hold it... this is absolutely ridiculous to see and hold in person,"** Brownlee notes, comparing it favorably to ultra-thin devices like the Moto Z while highlighting its stunning visual impact.

The thinness comes with significant trade-offs. The Air features a 3,149mAh battery - the smallest in the lineup - leading to concerning real-world performance. Brownlee reports achieving around 4.5 hours of screen-on time, which he characterizes as "C minus level" by today's standards. Apple's claim of 27 hours of video playback (compared to 22 for last year's iPhone 16) appears optimistic for varied real-world usage.

The device also sacrifices camera capabilities, featuring only a single main camera compared to the multi-lens systems on other models. There's no bottom speaker either - just microphones - eliminating stereo audio. Yet despite these compromises, the Air delivers a premium experience with titanium rails and the flagship A19 chip (minus one GPU core).

## Samsung's Counter-Punch: The S25 Edge Comparison

In a direct comparison with Samsung's competing S25 Edge, Brownlee reveals different philosophical approaches to ultra-thin design. The Samsung device maintains more features - a full flagship camera system, ultrawide lens, stereo speakers, and a larger 3,900mAh battery - while being slightly thicker than the iPhone Air.

**"I personally lean S25 Edge just a bit... I prefer having a better camera system,"** Brownlee admits, though he acknowledges the iPhone Air's superior thinness and distinctive aesthetic appeal.

## The Surprise Winner: iPhone 17 Base Model

Perhaps the most significant insight comes from Brownlee's assessment of the base iPhone 17, which he calls **"one of the best deals in all of smartphones."** This represents a major shift in Apple's value proposition.

Key improvements include:
- Starting storage increased to 256GB
- 120Hz display (finally matching Pro models)
- Improved primary and ultrawide cameras
- More powerful A19 chip
- $100 cheaper than comparable Pixel devices

**"As far as how much phone you get for your money, they've done a much better job finally in the base iPhone,"** Brownlee observes, suggesting this could be the sweet spot for most consumers.

## Pro Models: Power at a Premium

The iPhone 17 Pro models receive substantial internal upgrades, including increased RAM (12GB vs 8GB) and significantly larger batteries. The Pro Max breaks the 5,000mAh barrier for the first time, while the smaller Pro sees nearly 20% battery improvement year-over-year.

However, color choices remain controversial. The bright orange option proved divisive among early viewers, while the absence of a black Pro option forces users toward the blue variant for those seeking darker tones.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The Air is a statement piece**: While compromised in practical terms, it showcases Apple's engineering capabilities and will likely drive significant store traffic and social media attention.

2. **Base model finally competitive**: The iPhone 17 represents Apple's strongest value proposition in years, potentially reshuffling purchase decisions across the lineup.

3. **Pro models maximize everything**: With larger batteries, more RAM, and thicker designs, the Pro phones embrace a "more is more" philosophy.

4. **Battery anxiety remains**: Despite improvements across the lineup, the Air's battery life concerns highlight the ongoing challenge of balancing form factor with functionality.

The iPhone 17 series suggests Apple is experimenting with more diverse approaches to smartphone design, from ultra-premium thinness to compelling value propositions. While the Air captures attention with its remarkable engineering, the base iPhone 17 might prove the more impactful device for everyday consumers seeking flagship features without Pro pricing.
