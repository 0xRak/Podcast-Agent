# Base Token, Pumpfun's Rise, and Solana DATs | Livestream

In this 1h 17m episode from 0xResearch, the hosts dive deep into three major developments shaping the crypto landscape: Pump.fun's remarkable recovery and strategic pivots, Coinbase's exploration of a Base token and its broader implications, and the significant capital flows into Solana through DATs (Decentralized Autonomous Tokens).

The discussion reveals the evolving dynamics of crypto markets, where revenue-generating applications are beginning to outshine pure technology plays, and where the traditional "L1 premium" is being questioned as apps prove they can capture and distribute value more effectively than chains themselves.

## Pump.fun's Strategic Recovery

The conversation opens with Pump.fun's impressive 3x price surge, marking a significant comeback from its earlier struggles against Bonk.fun's competitive assault. **The key insight here is that Pump.fun demonstrated remarkable pricing power** - when Bonk attacked with 1.5% fees (higher than Pump's 1%), yet still managed to steal market share by giving 1% back to creators, it revealed that meme coin traders have highly inelastic demand.

Ryan Connor from Blockworks Research points out the critical strategic shift: **Pump's response wasn't just defensive but revealed their position of strength**. They increased buybacks from 25% to 100% of revenue, rolled out creator-focused fee tiers, and enhanced rewards structures. Most tellingly, they've now bought back 6.6% of their entire token supply, showing unprecedented alignment between the equity and token entities.

The broader lesson extends beyond Pump.fun: **this represents a new model where successful crypto applications can bypass traditional L1 premiums by directly rewarding token holders with revenue**. As one participant noted, "you had this entity trading close to its cash value that actually had a highly cash-flowing business" - a disconnect that the market eventually corrected.

## Base Token: Coinbase's Strategic Gambit

Coinbase's announcement that they're "exploring" a Base token opens fascinating questions about the evolution of L2s and exchange strategies. The discussion reveals the inherent tension Coinbase faces as a public company: **how do you launch a token without disadvantaging equity holders?**

The strategic implications are profound. Base has become the dominant L2, and as Ryan notes, "Base and Coinbase are building this to be a very successful venture for them - they want the win, they don't want Ethereum to have the win." The potential for Base to become its own L1 rather than remaining an L2 reflects the diminishing "L1 premium" in markets.

**The most intriguing possibility is Base adopting a Binance-like model**, where exchange revenues flow to token holders through buybacks and burns. However, as Ian Unsworth points out, this creates unprecedented complexity for a public equity: "if they do take revenue and buy and burn the token, if I was a shareholder of Coinbase, I'd be like 'I wanted that money.'"

This represents a broader shift in crypto where **successful applications are questioning why they need to pay rent to underlying L1s** when they can capture and distribute value directly to their own token communities.

## Solana DATs and Market Mechanics

The final segment explores Multicoin's $1.6 billion deployment into Solana at an average price of $232, representing an enormous 25% of Solana's annual inflation. This raises critical questions about sustainability and market mechanics that go beyond simple supply and demand.

**The core challenge for Solana DATs is differentiation from upcoming ETFs**. As the discussion reveals, "we're still trying to sell $1 for two when it doesn't really make sense." The premium these vehicles trade at becomes harder to justify once direct ETF access exists, unlike the earlier Ethereum DAT cycle where ETFs were already available.

The conversation touches on a crucial technical insight: **Solana's continued high inflation rate makes these large purchases more challenging to sustain**. Unlike Ethereum's deflationary mechanics, Solana continues to issue significant new supply, requiring constant capital inflows to maintain price levels.

However, the discussion also reveals potential upside through DeFi integration and productive treasury management, suggesting these DATs might differentiate through active yield strategies rather than passive holding.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Revenue-generating apps are displacing pure technology plays** - The market now rewards actual cash flows over technical innovation alone, fundamentally changing how crypto projects are valued.

2. **The "L1 premium" is eroding** - Successful applications like Pump.fun prove that direct value capture and distribution to token holders can be more effective than relying on underlying chain premiums.

3. **Exchange tokens represent the next evolution** - Base's potential token launch reflects a broader trend where successful platforms create their own value capture mechanisms rather than relying on underlying infrastructure.

4. **Sustainable tokenomics require careful consideration of inflation** - Solana's experience with DATs highlights the importance of supply-side mechanics in maintaining long-term value accrual.

This episode captures a pivotal moment in crypto's evolution, where the focus shifts from "what's technically possible" to "what generates sustainable value for token holders." The implications extend far beyond these specific cases, suggesting a maturation of crypto markets toward more traditional value-creation metrics.
