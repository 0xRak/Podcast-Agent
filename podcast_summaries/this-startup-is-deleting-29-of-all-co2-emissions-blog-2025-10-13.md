## Introduction

While the world races toward electric vehicles, there's a massive blind spot in our climate strategy: the hardest-to-electrify parts of transportation. Long-haul trucks and freight trains—responsible for 29% of all US emissions—aren't going electric anytime soon. Enter Remora, a YC-backed startup that's doing something no one has done before: retrofitting commercial trucks and freight trains with mobile carbon capture devices that can remove up to 90% of CO2 from exhaust, while creating a new revenue stream by selling that captured CO2 to beverage companies, greenhouses, and other industrial users.

Paul Gross, Remora's founder and CEO, started the company with zero technical background, no prototype, and just an idea. Today, his 43-person team in Detroit is manufacturing carbon capture systems in-house, has a 4,400-horsepower locomotive parked behind their headquarters for testing, and has raised $17 million to tackle what might be one of the most ambitious climate challenges of our time.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Point-Source Capture Beats Direct Air Capture—By Orders of Magnitude**

The carbon capture space is crowded with direct air capture (DAC) companies trying to pull CO2 straight from the atmosphere. But Remora is taking a fundamentally different approach: point-source capture at the tailpipe.

> "The challenge is that the air is extremely dilute. There's only 0.04% CO2 molecules in the air. The problem with processing air is that you have to use a lot more energy to pull CO2 out. So it ends up being far more expensive and creating more emissions as well."

Why does this matter? Because transportation emissions are concentrated and intense. A single freight train or long-haul truck produces massive amounts of CO2 in its exhaust stream—much higher concentrations than ambient air. By capturing at the source, Remora's system is dramatically more energy-efficient and cost-effective than trying to filter dilute atmospheric CO2.

The technology itself is elegantly simple: exhaust flows through cylinders filled with pea-sized pellets containing microscopic pores that trap CO2 molecules while letting other gases pass through. Once captured, the CO2 is purified to beverage grade (yes, the same quality used in your soda) and stored in pressure vessels. This isn't theoretical—it's working today on actual commercial trucks.

### 2. **Solving Two Problems Creates Market Pull (Not Just Push)**

Most climate tech startups face a brutal reality: they're asking customers to pay extra for environmental benefits. Remora flipped this dynamic by identifying a genuine market need: the US CO2 shortage.

> "I learned about this in college. I started with this question of why is there a CO2 shortage? Why aren't breweries able to get enough CO2 and yet we're emitting 375 million tons a year from trucks and trains."

This is brilliant problem-stacking. Instead of just reducing emissions (a regulatory push), Remora creates new revenue for truck operators by selling the captured CO2 to distributors who supply food and beverage companies, greenhouses, and water treatment facilities. The system both cuts costs (through potential carbon credits) and generates income (through CO2 sales).

This dual value proposition makes adoption far more compelling than pure climate solutions. Truck operators aren't just being asked to be environmentally responsible—they're being offered a potential profit center. In a low-margin industry like trucking, that changes the conversation entirely.

### 3. **Location Strategy: Build Where the Talent Is, Not Where VCs Are**

While most YC companies stay in the Bay Area after demo day, Paul and his team moved to Wixom, Michigan—30 minutes outside Detroit. This wasn't a cost-saving measure; it was talent strategy.

> "We built the company here because this is where the talent is. I think you have to think about if you're starting a company, where's the talent density for the talent that matters for your problem. In many cases, that's Silicon Valley. But for us, we are looking for mechanical engineers, electrical engineers. We're looking for people with experience packaging things, experience with things getting vibrated and shocked. That's Detroit."

This is a crucial lesson for hardware founders. Detroit has generations of engineers who understand thermal management, vibration testing, durability engineering, and manufacturing at scale—skills you need when your product will be shaken, heated, frozen, and subjected to years of constant use on highways and rail lines.

The team's decision to vertically integrate manufacturing in-house accelerates their iteration cycles. They have laser cutters, welding stations, electronics assembly, and machining tools right in their facility. When they discover an issue in testing, they can modify the design and have new parts fabricated the same day. For hardware, iteration speed is survival.

### 4. **Start with Nothing, Move Fast, Build in Public**

Perhaps the most counterintuitive insight: Remora applied to YC with literally nothing—no incorporated company, no prototype, no technical team. Just an idea and the willingness to learn fast.

> "We had nothing. We had no system. We hadn't even incorporated. We just had an idea that we told you about in the interview. I think that was the right time for us to apply to YC because the way I think about YC is it's like going to the gym with Olympians."

Paul's approach to building a deep-tech company without technical expertise is refreshingly pragmatic: "If you're a founder, you don't have to be the expert. You have to create a team of experts." He reached out to Christina Reynolds, who had just finished a PhD at the University of Michigan on carbon capture, and brought her on as co-founder. He built financial models, read scientific papers, and talked to experts to develop conviction.

The scale of ambition also matters. As Paul notes: "If you're going to spend 10 years of your life on this, you might as well just do the thing that's hardest, that's most interesting because you'll get to work with the best team... Ironically, it may end up being easier and it may be a bigger outcome as well."

Ambitious missions attract ambitious people. Incremental improvements attract incremental talent.

## Notable Quotes

> "People told me that what we were doing was impossible. But that's exactly the type of startup I want to work on. I wanted to create something where I could say if I don't build this it might not happen."

> "Within point source carbon capture, no one has ever done carbon capture on a commercial truck, commercial train, our systems will be the first in the world."

> "If you have a bunch of CO2 molecules, why not capture them at the source rather than scattering them out into the atmosphere and then trying to filter them back."

> "I would encourage other founders to expand their ambitions. I think a lot of times people start the company that seems doable, seems easy, but that's going to be hard, too."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Attack concentrated problems, not diffuse ones**: When choosing a technical approach, look for the highest-density version of your problem. Remora chose point-source over direct air capture because CO2 concentration in exhaust is 100x higher than ambient air—making the physics and economics vastly more favorable.

2. **Stack problems to create market pull**: The CO2 shortage gave Remora immediate market demand beyond just carbon credits. Look for ways your solution can solve multiple problems simultaneously, especially if one creates revenue while the other generates savings or compliance value.

3. **Optimize for iteration speed in hardware**: Remora's decision to manufacture in-house, build simulators, and locate in Detroit all serve one purpose: faster learning loops. In hardware, the team that can test and iterate fastest wins. Don't outsource critical paths.

4. **Build the team, not the expertise**: You don't need a PhD to start a deep-tech company—you need the ability to recruit PhDs and create an environment where they can do their best work. Focus on assembling the team of experts rather than becoming the expert yourself.

5. **Choose your geography strategically**: Where you build matters. Match your location to the specific talent you need. For software, maybe that's SF. For automotive hardware, it's Detroit. For biotech, it's Boston or San Diego. Talent density in your specific domain beats general startup ecosystem density.

## Conclusion

Remora is attacking one of the most intractable pieces of the climate puzzle—the 29% of emissions from transportation that can't easily be electrified. By capturing CO2 at the source, creating a revenue model around industrial CO2 sales, and building for manufacturability from day one, they're turning an "impossible" problem into a scalable business.

Their billion-ton-per-year ambition isn't just about trucks and trains. The same technology can scale to generators, container ships, cement plants, and natural gas turbines. If Remora succeeds, they won't just make a dent in US emissions—they'll create a new category of mobile carbon capture that could redefine how we think about industrial decarbonization.

For founders considering hard tech: Remora's story is proof that you don't need to start with expertise, capital, or even a prototype. You need a big problem, the humility to learn fast, and the audacity to build something the world says is impossible.
