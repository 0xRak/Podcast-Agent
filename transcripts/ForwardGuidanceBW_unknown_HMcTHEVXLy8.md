## Transcript

He admitted throughout the conference that there is no new information gathered effectively, right? But then explain the 180 degree stone cold pivot from the October meeting. >> I still think like the 2026 Fed funds curve is underpriced in terms of the amount of cuts we're going to get. Like to your point Quinn about how doubish Powell already is and then you throw Hasset in his replacement like it's just going to be insane. Republicans need to work on quote unquote affordability whether that's just giving more money to people but whatever they got to do they're going to do it. like they are really lagging for those midterms and they want to win them. So, you know, we're going to get more fiscal. >> You have to own hard assets  because they're going to run it hot next year.

And we are recording on a Wednesday right after FOMC day. The most important FOMC meeting of our lifetimes. Until the next one. I think I said that last time too. >> I have a question. Is uh is Quinn going on a safari or something? Look at that. Camo. >> The best thing is you gave me this from from Chubbies, bro.  >> I did. I did. >> So I sick self roast. >> You you just self roasted. Yes. The best part is for people listening, we didn't even plan this, but Tyler gifted me a bunch of apparel items out of his closet actually probably like last year now. And so I I saw this when I was cleaning up and I was like, I'm gonna wear this and see if he remembers. >> I didn't even remember. I was like, but you know, I think I have something similar. So >> that's a good look, man. I love it. Yeah, guys, we're recording after uh FOMC meeting. Fed cut rates. And we'll get into the semantics and the details in a second, but uh we were just laughing off camera about how the theme is just, you know, Powell's, he's just trying to coast until the end, I think. And it just reminded me of this clip from Super Bad, so I just want to play it. >> What are you making? I'm just drilling holes last two weeks. it. >> Oh, is that Powell? >> That was Pal. >> Yeah, >> that's our guy. >> He literally He said at the end of the interview, >> Yeah. He's like, I'm gonna I'm gonna just make it so, you know, we're we have a good jobs market and inflation is low for the next Fed governor, and that's what I'm hoping for. >> Yeah, that's the best that's the best that I can do. Um, >> and by the way, I'm gonna I'm gonna add 40 billion to the the T bills, too, and create a true true Ponzi. >> Two minutes. >> That's it. Okay, let's let's start with that for a minute. So, I'm going to I'm going to Yeah, two minutes in. Let's let's recap a few of these these points here. So all right, we've been talking about the liquidity crunch that's been going on in bank reserves. Obviously, we had the end of QT at the last meeting and that ended in December and we started to hit the hiccup zone where we started to see a lot of uptake from the standing repo facility. We started to see us getting to that that hiccupy level of bank reserves and ending QT was just not enough. Like they've been tapering QT for ages. So in reality, the end to QT was only like $5 billion a month of difference. We needed to see more happen. And I think a lot of people are expecting them today to announce plans to start this in January. And I don't think many people expected this amount of of bills that they're trying to buy. So here's what we got. So in the statement regarding reserve management purchase operations, you can see in the highlighted area just says with a total amount of R&P's reserve management uh purchases of approximately $40 billion in treasury bills purchases will start on December 12th. The desk anticipates that the pace of R&Bs will remain elevated for a few months to offset expected large increases in non-reserve liabilities in April. So, this was part of the the inspiration for me at least to bring up that super bad clip, which is just it's it's pretty funny to think that the timing of of RIP in this just ends right when Pal ends his term and we move into the next phase. So yeah, I want to start there just get your guys' take at least on on the uh acronym factory being spun up again here. I guess I would start high level first off is she admitted at the beginning of the or throughout the conference that there is no new information gathered effectively right but then explain the 180°ree stone cold pivot from the October meeting right so like first of all just at a high level like it's just a big reminder that that they have no clue so when he said in October we need to slow down because it's foggy out and we don't have data like that's their status quo of operating. They they they have they have no consensus or direction or conviction in in any of these views, I think. So, this is just we we're reminded of that frequently with how often they pivot. But this was another reminder of of them point blank saying basically not anything new came through, but yet we're now predicting inflation to roll over next year. we're now, you know, seeing much greater weakness in the labor market and all of these things were there in October at when they like decidedly marketkedly said, "Oh, we don't know about December." And and really, you know, put a damper and it goes to show that I think it's pretty obvious they just want to take some air out of the balloon. The other thing is probably my favorite probably the most succinct summary if you to listen to just like a two-minute clip was from the woman who asked so uh Mr. Paul, when you're thinking about uh rate cuts here, you know, um what changed from from last meeting where you said December was uncertain and uh you know, we'll see. And he basically said, well, uh inflation, what did he say? He said inflation is at, she said, cuz inflation's at 3%, it's been running above target for XYZ period of time. And kind of called him out on that. And and he goes, we're committed to 3%. uh you know, we're going to get it there, but did you do you see the labor market? It's weakening. Like, so she basically was like, "Hey, look, are you basically admitting that 3% is fine?" And he's like, "No, we're committed, but look at the labor market, you know?" Then he pulled this 60k jobs number, which is probably true in terms of like NFP, subtract 60 from NFP and that's the real number. But he never like really talks about the labor market in those terms. If he used that in October, it would have been the same problem. Like anyways, it's just a cluster. But the moral of the story is this is Powell. Imagine when we get to Trump's guy and that's four months away. He even said like for example on the reserves 40 billion a month and then we'll taper it after April. He's like he's that's when he leaves. It's like we're going to run it 40 billion you know elevated into when I leave and then we'll see what the next guy does. And we know what's gonna happen. It's just it's just kind of Anyways, it was a long rant there, but there's just so many inconsistencies, but you have to own hard assets because they're going to run it hot next year. >> I'm I'm with that. I also think we're seeing a rotation. Go to slide 37. You kind of see this uh ratio between small caps and large cap tech. And what was really fascinating to me was in November where I was saying, you know, now is not the time to be a hero. at the lows in IWM. We saw the credit credit stress and regional banks etc. I think that was the flag to the Fed that we need to start doing something with liquidity because if they didn't do anything then I think we could have probably had the credit crisis. That's why I was a little bit nervous is they might actually let this thing roll over and of course you know they don't because they have to >> the VA controllers came in. >> Yeah. And they really did. they came in and they already started buying you know some some treasury bonds in at that point just to kind of stoaltify the volatility. It's it's centrally planned economy and from that point at that low in November IWM and regional banks have been up in a straight line and that's really what what's fascinating to me is like now we're seeing the rotation in small caps because the Fed has the markets back and then if you go to the the previous slide you can kind of see look at this motion in IWM that sell off in November was so vicious to absolutely pivot and go to new highs. And now we're in, you know, uh uh we're we're making new highs, all-time highs in IWM, which is this is probably a good thing for the lower and middle income buckets now, which is you're seeing the rotation into smaller cap stocks. So, it's not just hopefully it's not just this central uh large cap tech dystopia. So that's that's actually a good thing in my opinion is you know maybe in the next six months we'll see money go to different pockets of the economy and we're seeing Dow transports are kind of rallying IWM's rallying um and then we got Oracle after the bell which is you down I think it's like down 7% right now maybe maybe some of that AI money goes and flows into different parts of the economy here. So the the leadership is changing um off the backs of this and we'll we'll see uh how it shakes out from here. this is the problem they're going to run into and there's I've seen a number of things about inflation probably comes down um next year in the first first part of the year which I I'm I'm sure you know these forecasters are directionally accurate but inflation is a very psychological thing and and self-fulfilling thing and when the prevailing narrative everywhere is run it hot print like you start to get consumer and institutional behavior that resembles that. And I think one of the things we should talk about is the long-end bond yield. Everyone's like, wait, what's going on there? Like it just randomly selling off. And you know, there is attractive growth comps for for the first half of next year as these, you know, tariff and immigration thing one-time effects roll off. But when you start signaling to the market like as sort of aggressively as you know even maybe this meeting was starting to do in in terms of supporting um not worrying about inflation anymore and then what probably will happen. There's a very psychological effect that you know people start saying well I need to I want to borrow because this is going to depreciate and and I want long-term debt. They invest that money. They buy hard assets. their behav consumer behavior institutional behavior changes and that's why inflation is so kind of self-reinforcing and psychological um and it doesn't show up right away but you know maybe they just keep getting oil prices lower and lower but uh that's a thing to look out for I'd say >> yeah I mean like my line of thinking is if it feels like we went through a mini a very shortdated recession but we got it papered over because of the AI capex Ponzi that was going on because of the reversal in immigration flows that has kept like the the break even rate of labor much more manageable. But overall, like I feel like we're we're making our way through that now. And you compare that to what we saw and I just want to pull up the the SEP data. So this this Fed meeting was also a summary of economic projections update. So just want to go through a couple of the points here just to look at how the the Fed is thinking about this this growth outlook and you can see it's it's it's a pretty goldilocks outcome. So we had real GDP forecast of 2026 that was revised up to 2.3% from 1.8 unemployment down core PCE down and Fed funds consistent. So just a few charts to look at this and you can see so pretty constructive on growth into 2026 which is interesting and really no change to the unemployment rate and core PCE a little bit more disinflation than what was expected. So yeah, to me it feels like we're we're coming through the other side of this and then if we get this continuation of rate cuts that we're getting um and I still think like the 2026 Fed funds curve is underpriced in terms of the amount of cuts we're going to get like to your point Quinn about how dovish Paul already is and then you throw a hasset in his replacement like it's just going to be insane. Um >> yeah. >> Yeah, I I I agree. I think it might be stop start here for the next couple weeks potentially and you know this this reserve management operation thing that's supposed to end when Pal leaves is is or or reduce is is a joke. So like that's that's going to maybe it's not QE. I I don't think it is but but it it it's going to morph into something once he's out. And the dot plot though is hawkish. So if you get one sort of like hawkish data print here, which I think inflation next week potentially could if it if it's another high print before the the roll over into early next year, you know, you might have some spooks along the way. But the the other just thing I just can't stop thinking about is is I I I believe asset selection is very important here because when I look at the screen even for today, right, it's like you you the the hysteria around of how dovish and how bullish and all these things and I look and it's like mag 7 was flat. Mag 7 was up four bips. Nvidia was down. Small caps were ripped. um metals all green pretty much gold, silver, copper, and and obviously the dollar got smoked, but but longer tail things, not necessarily, you know, Bitcoin not not that great. Um, so I think asset selection going into a year like next year where I think everybody largely agrees on the run it hot, but I think where there's I would say some things floating out there that I don't really agree with as much is is you know how to be allocated for the the scenario and and which I think is going to become increasingly important um you know headed into what's likely to be plenty of fits and starts but but directionally a run it hot environment and and so we'll see cuz the the big question I guess is when inflation starts to come back if it does maybe it's the second half you know um if we get some positive seasonality and stuff in the first half and then that that is true gold delocks but I just think there's um certain assets that are perform way better if you're thinking about crypto investing but don't want to open a new account or manage keys and wallets check out Gayscale Grayscale has been offering trusted crypto investment products for over a decade with 30 plus counting, including single asset funds like Bitcoin and Ethereum, diversified portfolios, and thematic exposure to the broader digital asset space.

I don't know if we're going to get the super spike in inflation though. Go to um slide 34. This is ch China's trade performance. And if you look at export growth on lower value ad goods, I mean this is which is heavily exposed to the US market. This is from trivium. Um the export of toys slumped 12.1%, footwear 10.7%, furniture fell 5.9%. So the demand side is going down as you know the tariffs take you know uh >> they're definitely eating a brunt of the price impact for sure. >> Yeah. And and maybe that's not the worst thing is like like crappy consumer goods don't lead our economy. It's like, hey, maybe we'll invest in some real stuff. And maybe that's what industrials are are telling us here is. But look at this. These other numbers is are pretty are pretty nuts, which is overall exports to the US declined 28.6% year-over-year while shipments to Africa surged 27.5%, Latin America 14%, EU grew 14%. So they are still they have a still massive uh trade uh balance in in their favor. And then if you go to the next chart, you could kind of see this on a chart. Export growth um is rising while imports are going down. So it's net net positive for China uh in this whole trade scheme. >> Yeah, I saw a funny comment that was like uh Trump managed to get a a manufacturing boom to happen. It's just it happened in China, not in the US. Yeah,  it's it's kind of wild how, you know, you're trying to change 40 years of globalization and manufacturing on a dime and the the uh the beginning of the year and now, oh, this is a lot harder than we thought. >> Well, I think yeah, I I'm certainly I I actually expect I mean oil's still not it might be bottoming here, but but it's not saying, you know, screaming inflation. So I my base case is that inflation does come down and you know that's why in October I thought they pivoted hawkish at the exact worst time. But um the thing I guess my bigger argument is just like large cap tech which is you know we know the whole S&P 500 at this point like doesn't really have much much room to go higher outside of earnings growth. it's kind of reached like what would probably be a ceiling multiple. And so, you know, if you're if you're playing to outperform that, you you have to be geared towards some of these other sectors, I think, that are more attractive cyclical mainstream type things that to your point, Tyler, like small caps relative to to that. Probably this should kind of set the tone assuming uh no more hawkish pivots between now and April. You know what's else is interesting is if you go to slide uh 38 and Quinn you touched on this last week. This is normally when the Fed starts cutting long-term interest rates also decline. This from Torston Slock at Apollo he's always got good charts. Um but you can see when the Fed funds rate is lowered the 10-year yield normally goes down but you know what's happened since 2024 is the 10ear yield's risen. And you you brought that up how the long end is is is going higher. And I think that's why banks, you know, if you make the if you print 4040 billion dollars on the front end and banks have more money to lend, this is really going to be a a lending driven market, which is what I think small caps are kind of telling us right now. >> Main Street has been crushed. No demand. Like that's what spreads have been so tight because of a of a of a high yield supply issue like you know record capital flows to private credit and and these fixed income funds with with you know finally we're getting this big boost in M&A activity and and more paper and and next year that's that's probably something to watch is you know when you do stimulate the economy like this and you have such high expectations of M&A and other financing activity as a result uh spreads you know, yields go up here and and spreads might might also be going up because of of increased supply. And my f another I guess my second favorite line if my first favorite line of the week was from Paul saying, "Yeah, we're committed to getting inflation back to two, but did you see the labor market? It's like my my other favorite line was Hasset saying we now have more room to to stimulate fiscally." And I was like and I pulled up I was like wait am I see the fiscal deficit to G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G GP is still like 5 and a half%. I was like >> and then there's just the CBO budget released last week or two weeks ago that they updated they're like oh since the administration didn't follow through with as draconian tariffs we're actually reducing the amount we're bringing in so the budget deficit's worse and I was like what room is he talking about? >> I was I wanted to bring that up. I was just thinking about it and it's just yeah it's such a great lesson and um you know you see all these people over the past few months do all this like obsessive quantitative analysis on fiscal impulses and it's like oh the the train is stopping you know and then all it takes is one one guy to just drop the hammer and say oh look we're doing another reconciliation bill in 2026 and it's like well time to go reset all your priors and the fact of the matter is is that they have midterms to win and they are doing terrible right now like Republicans need to work on quote unquote affordability, whether that's just giving more money to people. Um, but whatever they got to do, they're going to do it. Like they are really lacking for those midterms and they want to win them. Um, so, you know, we're going to get more fiscal. That's just the name of the game at this age. >> That is the name of the game. We're in a the old centrally planned boomer ponds. Got to love it. The easiest trade is is just following what the government does at this point. And although I will say we might take a little hiccup here in the AI trade depending on uh we'll see how Oracle trades tomorrow but it's uh it's might take a little breather. >> What what makes you say that? >> I don't know. I just we're seeing this rotation into small caps. small small caps are breaking out higher and you probably have, you know, if you look at EPS, Ford EPS, the growth rates, a lot of that stuff is actually going up while you're taking on this giant capex uh in large cap tech on on the on the debt side of things. So, you usually get the AR arbitrageers when you issue a lot of debt, they short your stock, there's a lot of supply there. So, maybe we'll see that rotation. One one interesting thing on the inflation point. Uh Tony Pascarella had put this chart out. Slide 29. Uh Quinn's talked about this before, but this is the 24 uh month rolling volatility of US core CPI inflation month overmonth. And this is really what I think the vault controllers look at at the end of the day is they do not want this inflation to spike because you can really you can really put patches on the boat that's sinking if this volatility of CPI stays lower and you can you can even though it might not actually track like actual inflation it's what policy makers can keep the balance sheet intact with. So as long I'm going to be watching this, but as long as the V of the CPI kind of stays low, they can this systematic constant reinvestment of of passive flows I think still still happens. But this is what really breaks the back when you see a spike in in CPI vault. >> This is such a good chart, Tyler, and great point. Um, this is what allows this chart is why like every macro strategist is is right on a five-year view but wrong on a on a six-month view because when V is so low like this and it just creeps up creeps up and we're just seeing this this K-shaped economy lasting for four years where Main Street is drowning like 80 I I that tweet I put out this week I was shocked by this data 83% of new NFP jobs this year were healthcare services. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Uh Felix, if you go to slide 21, this so CPY had that feudalism piece and I and it got me thinking about some like because I saw also saw that Torson slack um you know the largest ever percentage of wealth owned by Americans over 70 and then I I ran the data of NFP and and it's been increasing from 3% of new jobs in 21 to 83% of new jobs just straight line. And so basically the economy is at a standstill and and there was also the reports right earlier in the year of like GDP growth would be zero if it wasn't for AI. So it's just like boomers like health care services for boomers and and then basically keeping the asset bubble PI going is is the sole driver of the economy. Everybody else is underwater and and then but because the volatility of inflation is so low >> Yeah. Yeah, Trump can go on a press conference and say, "This affordability thing is nonsense. What are you talking about affordability?" And and then everyone's like, "Uh, dude, don't say that. You can't say that." Yeah. Like so it's it's >> we're just becoming less and less dynamic with pockets of stories like story sectors of the economy that potentially could grow out of you help GDP grow. But largely we're you know there's no man there's really no manufacturing base relative to China. We we can't produce things >> now. AI is gutting our tech base. >> Yeah. And it's it's really kind of it's really just so and then and then you're just pushing more and more people to health care and to take care of the boomers. It's I don't know. >> Story sector is your nice way of saying uh grifting the you know Trump family's pockets basically. >> Yeah, pretty much. I love your pivot on Trump.  >> I'm just I just call >> he's call he's calling balls and strikes. >> Yeah. >> I when they do good I say it's good when they do dumb it's it's like I was like that last year, too. And and then but you know, everyone gets so heated and it's like I I think Bessant's a rock star, but I also think he's going to have a absolute hell of a time in 26. I think Hasset's a brilliant economic adviser. He's going to be under the shotgun pressure at the Fed. Like there's so much you you have to hold so many truths in your mind at once. And like, >> you know, Trump has done a lot of good things. I do think long term we need to rebalance away from China, secure more resources, all these things, but you know, politics is hard, man. >> Yeah. And the the it's going to be it's going to be hard what happens in the Fed next year, too. Like maybe that's what the curve is is sniffing out is that it's going to be hard to get consensus next year and that's why we haven't priced enough cuts in. But like you look at today's meeting and you had desents on both sides. You had Moran descenting for 50 bips on on the dove side. Then he had Goulsby and forget who the other person was. Um >> Schmidt >> Schmidt both descent. Um and you know like Goulsby he was right up until the election he was one of the biggest doves ever. Like throughout the whole wave of inflation he was talking about cuts basically like the dovish of doves. And now suddenly he's grown a backbone and he's talking about dissenting and and and being hawkish. And yeah, I think that's going to continue and maybe that's why they're trying to to gain gain control of the Fed presidents. Like, you know, it seems like there's a lot of different approaches that they're speculating and and dropping nuisance to right now. Like the most recent one was Trump made a comment this week about how he heard that some of the auto pen was used for some of the nomination of some of the Fed presidents. And you can just kind of see it's like they're just they're just kicking the tires on uh how they can go about basically getting a majority vote of the FOMC. and it's just it's going to be messy.

As always, investments and blockchain technology involve risk, terms, and conditions apply. Do your own research. I think how I think about like sort of run it hot like so first off you need the fiscal policy to uh effectuate run it hot you need a change right OBB the big beautiful bill has the tax incentives um for capex capital expenditure investments uh for for corporates and small businesses that is one thing we're probably starting to see a slight uptick there you will see um bank uh regulations relax which will allow them you to do more in small business and mortgage sectors, increase their balance sheet. So you increase lending to Main Street effectively through those channels because those have been starved. Everybody large cap tech, etc. Everyone's is that that stuff's fine. Um so it's really Main Street there. And then um the other big one uh in it is is just if there's a a a stimulus bill. So you need the fiscal side to come through. Um but at the end of the day like yeah with with whoever's appointed Fed like it we know it's happening like it just it's just the dollar is is going to probably sniff it out first and then you know other assets from there >> actually you know it it started rolling over for the first time ever the the big question I have on the dollar is at what point if it really rolls over too hard too fast does the long go >> does the carry trade online do does the long end go and you know what what is the implications when this happens too far too fast and that's I I don't think we see it in December just because it's such a low volatility holiday period but that's something in the first quarter we could probably run into >> yeah I think the most important correlation to track for that is whether if you're seeing equities US equities down bond yields up and Dixie down. That's like capital outflows and that's like that's you know the the fire alarm like that's what was the fire alarm in April. So you got to keep a track on that for sure. >> The current Fed estim or or like priced in market estimates of Fed action is basically um it's basically on hold until April which for as dovish as like these reserve management operations etc. um 40 billion a month through uh a whatever April tax day. Um if the like I don't think everything's hunky dory for let's just say risk assets generally if if if they don't cut until April. Um I I think they will cut sooner. So that's not a massively crazy or extreme bearish take. But so to your point, Tyler, before we get, you know, actual fiscal policy change and and the the Trump Fed overtake, I think I think that's why certain assets like metals and and gold particularly are doing well and and you're seeing some other riskier assets kind of floundering because there's still, you know, near-term hiccups potential and it's also not clear that the long-term benefits. How can you steer like the whole point of next year and winning the election is steering money away from AI and Magg 7 like and so I'm I'm actually short a basket of of things in the semis and mag seven area against long metals because I think I think that's sort of like you want to be long there's other versions of this trade you could be long KR which popped off today or anything that's tied to main street cyclicality I think is >> that's been unloved not the stuff that's been >> super loved. The hard part about that for me is you're you're you're betting against a rising tide of passive inflow where every 30 cents of a dollar goes to all those large cap techs and then then they buy back their stock too which buybacks are still on till like I think December 19th as a good >> but if there's no new jobs so if job growth is actually negative is that like you it's just it's a weaker pace of that now like if if you were betting against that in 20 when the job market was printing 200k new jobs every >> I think Mike Green talks about this a little but like there comes a point where >> this reflexivity where it's like you actually can never have job losses of a true recession again because then that's the beginning of the passive unwind which like absolutely can happen. So >> the draconian scenarios of like if they actually do want to rebalance all these things like it's just print. They have to print. There's printing now to keep things propped up. Imagine what they do when things aren't so rosy. >> Yeah. >> The the first hint of a crisis and it's just Yeah, it's it's game on. >> You want to see something kind of wild? Go to >> this is uh part of the the credit cycle still intact. >> Oh, this is maybe the the previous one. So this is high yield spreads, you know, we we sporadically show this this chart, but the high yield uh yield to worst and high yield spread to worst. So on the top chart, this is the the red line is the spread to worst. So you're at basically rock bottom, high yield spreads, which means a lot of these like crappier companies can finance themselves really well. You're seeing a lot of short squeezes off crappier run companies. And then the the actual yield is almost under 7%. Let's see it's um yeah 6.81% yield to worst in high yield which is fantastic right you can as a really crap crappily run company you can issue debt at 6%. You know that that that's really great and you can do a lot of different things with it and then uh you can see the supply is actually dropping in high yield bond issuance into year end here. That's the lower chart. The gross and uh refinancing has dropped in December which you know if you have inflows and no supply that gets spreads come even lower. And then if you go to the next chart I feel like you can kind of get a sense of the credit cycles like when this one um spikes to the upside that means credit's getting better and when it rolls over to the downside like it did in you know 2008 and in 2020. This is the upgrade to downgrades of of high yield. If the credit's getting worse, we're we're basically just like putting along here. There's not a lot of upgrades, not a lot of downgrades, but everything's largely just just fine. So, not really a lot to report. And I think on the credit side of things from that um from that standpoint. And then the la the last thing I probably wanted to show was just in terms of the what happened today specifically on slide 41. This is more of a when you have nothing happening in credit and after the event risk of the Fed. I've been kind of loud on Twitter about this, but I watched like implied correlation just cave. And this is a a different time frame chart of implied correlation, but just like fell when when stocks are correlated correlation of one, they all move up and down together. But when they have a low implied correlation, that means some stocks are rising, other stocks are falling. you have, you know, basically like a wide uh dispersion of of returns across the market, which holds the VIX down because the VIX goes up when implied correlation rises. So, this kind of should theoretically pull the VIX down uh over the next like couple weeks as liquidity is is not there. No real credit problems, no real scarce from the Fed, no real big earnings problems. Maybe we get a little pop involved tomorrow after Oracle and AI, but I don't know. On the whole, I think everything's kind of fine here. >> So, what do you guys think about the rest of the year here, Santa rally or not? It feels like there's we're pretty well suited for it. I don't know what you guys think. Like, you have V coming off. You have the targeting funds that are reallocating CTAs. CTAs are pretty strong. You have buybacks at the end of the year. Like you said, Pal's giving the green light. You're starting to see some >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Exactly. So, yeah. How are you guys thinking about the rest of the year here as you close up your book? >> I'm I'm long. The things I like uh which we've talked about metal cyclicals. Um basically every dip in in energy. Uh bought some bought the net gas dip today. Like you will not Yeah. And I said I'm short a basket of semis and me seven stuff. I I think I don't know like I don't I don't have a view on the Santa rally. Like the VIX is at I mean the VIX is at what 15 16 like I I'm not it's not like it's going from 25 to it's it's just and people it the market re repositioned. I had a couple charts if you go to just rip through 23. This is just a longer term cross asset volatility snapshot from that CB CBOE puts out, but it just shows you like look, gold is really the only interesting V surface right now. Um, equity rad little pops get suppressed. As Tyler mentions, this is the name of the game. Keep this stuff down. And and probably more interesting, like most interesting is the FX vault. It's, you know, one way to describe that is just like globally coord coordinated cahoots of of of policy that supports assets. And so, you know, you look at this and it just kind of, yeah, there's not big boogeyman out there, but also people aren't hedged. Um but I do look at like the next chart uh the next two charts and I think like you know these are these are relative of of cap cap share for S&P information technology and commun communication services it's likeif 50% of the S&P the next one if you go to it uh split up by sectors and is AI the future yes but also worst all the news that comes out about Nvidia now is basically that's what I say when I think the market has a mag seven problem is like the news is I think bearish. It's like last harra fine you can sell into China. All these competitor chips coming online. Um you know for all we know China doesn't even really want the chips because they have a so like it's not a bearish AI thing necessarily. It's like it just happens in every semiconductors have been around for decades and they always are there one of the most traditionally known cyclical businesses. Like everybody it's this very classic thing. So like you have a huge investment boom wherever there's profits, investment comes and and chases those profits down and especially when China enters the room. And so I just think you look across the board and you have all these sectors that have just been left for dead for many years and at the end of the day we're all still humans. So we need energy, we need utilities, we need a place to live, we need like so I think investing across those but then but if you do look at the um the next couple is just positioning maybe the next this one is just shows the panic index which was almost a high you know in in November now back to the lows. So people have definitely repositioned and then the next one too is consolidate equity positions from DB is back. Um so I don't know like that's that's kind of my view. I don't think like there's any very obvious like broad picture beta trade here going into the year end. And I know my sentiment is like just get away from the markets for a while. So, uh you know, I think people are like, h I don't know who's really sticking their neck out here. It's time for the holidays. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. But but no, I like it. Like, oh, >> what is that? This is my This is Monster Alpha. This is our our mask this year. Yeah. This >> That's the Muddy Waters mascot. >> My buddy just run. >> That's awesome.  >> Yeah, I got I got one good chart that you're going to love. This is 31. This is another another Gold Coleman one. on the back of what you meant about like the name of the game is just stoaltifying volatility because and this goes to Mike Green's whole point is the boomers have the balance sheet and you the next generation's income statement from that piece look at how much the top 1% and the 50 you know the the 50 the 90th to 99th percent so the top 10% own all the wealth there and then look at the bottom 50% it's like a little tiny sliver of of wealth is is trickling down to them. Um, you can, you know, you can make all sorts of arguments, but what I what I want to say just sociologically is I listen to Piers Morgan and Nick Fuentes and it was I don't know if you listen to this thing. >> That was wild. That was just wild. >> There was just rage bait on both sides there. It was a generational like moment I thought because you had this like Gen X boomer could not process this guy's mentality of just being outright racist and and then he and then Fuentes basically says like what are you going to do? I'm just racist. what are you and like he couldn't it was like two worlds collide because he's coming from this place that he's already lost everything you know in a lot of terms and now because he's not afraid to say like the craziest he's getting more and more viewers and that's what a lot of people like when I see that chart that previous chart is you're seeing a lot of people fall into the basket of like well I got nothing else to lose so I'm just going to point the finger at somebody else and and when you have that problem it's and and It's incapable for the boomers to understand that that's an issue like that or like the Gen X mindset of mainstream media is like now he's getting all these views and he's becoming more powerful being the Hitlerish type of of person saying all sorts of crazy stuff but he doesn't care and and like they >> his base loves it. the power and control uh is changing and therein that chart says it all which is like I'm trying the more I try to maintain balance of my my balance sheet and and stoaltify the volatility there in lies this sociological change that's happening and they they still can't process it and I not saying it's right or wrong it's just an a cause and effect right you stoivy v you get the this is the reaction And this centralization process will keep happening until the revolt happens, right? Until that and you're seeing he's even telling you, I'm making millions now. He's like, I don't care. You can't control me anymore. I can say whatever the hell I want. And he's making millions basically doing this. And the power structures are shifting where the V yeah on the surface you can staltify the asset volatility or the FX volatility or all these things through fiat mechanisms but the social ramifications are are getting worse and worse and and they're breaking through the mainstream and becoming mainstream and so eventually that leads through to asset prices. I don't know when it's gonna happen, but all the centralization scheme is is it's they just keep doing the same tools and they think it's fine. But when I when I when I watch that, it's frightening. It's absolutely >> You landed the plane so well on this, Tyler, when you first brought out. I was like I was like, we're gonna get cancelled. >> Mine here, but like >> No, that was that was a banger because some sometimes when you try to go and explain this, it goes the wrong way. But that was perfect. Yeah, you >> it's like a it the world the market take any structure and it's it's an amoeba of it has a characteristic of volatility that is normal and you can hold it down hold it down and that looks good here but pockets of it are popping off and you see that with these huge rotations in the market where it's like the S&P's flat but then MAG7's up seven and Main Street's down seven and to your like how I think about what you just said is like it makes so much sense you're suppressing suppressing suppressing, you know, huge swasts of society and you're going to get these guys popping off that are saying ridiculous crazy. And all that says is like volatility is not going away. It's actually increasing under the surface and that the >> I mean, wasn't it wasn't it Chris Cole that said it like >> you can't suppress volatility, you can only transfer it. Yeah. Yeah. Think about that quote all you transmute it. >> You transmute volatility, you can't suppress it. >> And so it shows you Yeah. you you suppress it in in assets and wealth inequality and it shows up in social like social uncoes or like just falling >> which is crazy because like you look at you look at society you look at wealth inequality you look at rich vers poor all these you know the the diversity of of the political spectrum is as extreme you know on both sides and then you look at markets and you're like VIX 15 FX V in the gutter but you're like what the heck and >> it's it's what makes markets so difficult because you have to hold these truths like we were saying and and but at some point it will matter because people will come people will come for that prize jewel um >> but it it just takes a long time but it it is Tyler great point like it's it's fascinating to see some of these things where >> like it's so extreme you're like man I can't believe he's saying this >> but if you were the beneficiary of the system for like 40 you you literally cannot comprehend that mindset. >> And but I I I think I'm close enough to the next generation where like, oh yeah, if you got, you know, $200,000 of student loans and you can't find a job, you're going to get extreme pretty fast, right? And and >> this is why the it's it's not sustainable to have a system where you a government just prints money and makes markets go up forever because eventually you have social revolt basically and like too much inflation and eventually they come for the assets. Like this is what Ray Del talks about about in terms of the deleveraging of these long-term debt cycles. Like one of those versions is revolution and coming for the rich and quote unquote redistribution of that wealth. And it doesn't look pretty. like go look at the French Revolution. It's not a pretty process >> and they're not. This is like here's >> I think we're pretty much pretty balanced guys for our generation in terms of like trying to see things from every perspective. Like I get what the built etc. But this is a national security issue where you have to you have to break apart companies. you have to literally just tear apart these monopolies, get the regulations like gone. Unless you want to see, you know, more and more extreme social commentary and more extreme, you know, violence and all that crime, that's fine. But like, I don't know that I think my use of of this stuff is I would like to see capitalism work in the way it should. I'd love to see like rational optimism like win, productivity win, and all this stuff, but it doesn't seem like there's a fire under anyone's ass from a political standpoint because they I think they're still milking it. They're milking it until you you can't anymore. >> Every aspect of the world, whether it's the financial markets, every single thing as it everything's become increasingly financialized, short- termism in every single facet of life. No one >> can't the there's a huge >> problem across developed nations of delaying gratification. Every decision you make in life is that's worth it is difficult because you're you're delaying gratification for something better in the future. And third like at the onset of what Trump campaigned on, we're going to balance the budget. We're going to cut unnecessary spending. We're like this stuff is you have to take pain. But so it's a it's just bigger than any one person. They're grifting it, you know, every they're grifting it hard. But that's just the the predicament is like it's unfortunate because there's so many smart people out there who see the problems and have solutions that want to try and fix them on both sides of the aisle. Uh but they will never be able to in a very effective way because you will the repercussions in the short term will be too politically unstable. And that that that's what you just you can never get past with how far gone developed nations problems are like >> and it's largely a legal issue. That's the thing is it's not even though >> but it's political reelection like it's like favorability. It's like I mean if Trump didn't pivot on tariffs like imagine right like he probably would have been assassinated. Imagine Trump said tomorrow like executive order I don't even know if you can do this but like every incremental dollar can't go back to the same passive scalable people it has to go into like a an American actively managed fund instead like imagine  >> well that's the thing is they the government controls what pension what what retirement accounts can invest in they approve these like target date retirement funds like pretty soon they're gonna have to put the retirement date target funds is 100% bonds because no one else is going to want to buy the debt. So, they're going to have to mandate. I mean, they're basically doing that with the banks. They're saying to the banks, "Hey, free up all this balance sheet. We'll deregulate you so you can stuff your stuff full of >> Yeah, it's financial repression in action." We are we are in the middle of it for sure. >> And that makes the conviction for gold and medals, sorry, is just makes it that much like this this is probably like a bigger cycle than we think. everyone. It's the beginning of it. It's not the end of it. >> Well, I just want to bring up it what a shame it is about like how crypto's trading recently because everything we talk about is like it was built for it. Like this is this should be Bitcoin's moment and it and it hasn't been. Um no way you cut it. Like when you when you really boil it down to what has been the marginal driver of price, like the vast majority of it has been micro strategy and DATs. Um, and then obviously just the the unlock of ETFs and that whole thing like that that brought in a marginal bid. But when you when you when you set the the playing field flat and you say, "Okay, here's the premise of what's going on in the macro world, place your bets, that actor is just not choosing Bitcoin. They're choosing precious metals. They're choosing gold, silver, etc. or or equities." And yeah, they're not buying crypto. And it's a shame. and and maybe the thesis is wrong or maybe this is just a local bottom. I don't know. >> So, I don't I think the sentiment is spot on. Most things outside of Bitcoin also are just garbage and deserve to be at zero. I think the problem is that the industry as it scaled became the same thing as everything else which was a griff Ponzi scam pilered by the top 1%. I mean, look at the VCs that Max extracted along the way and now, you know, they made a >> billion dollar slop about how the crypto industry is falling apart after they extracted it all. >> Yeah. So, you basically need this cleanse because you need these it just markets markets are so truth seeeking, right? Over over long periods of time, markets are truth seeking. And what's going to happen in my view is that like all this kind of stuff gets cleansed. You're going to have these pe people go away, but but Bitcoin survived everything. Bitcoin Bitcoin is still an asset for these events. And if you look at it on a long-term monthly type of charts and like like the structure is fine. It's like it was propped up by pro like it was propped up by DATs and all these VC exit liquidity schemes and it's rinsing that out and there will be buyers that will step in and there will be another big catalyst that sends it again and speculation will come back and so in some respects the four-year cyclers are are correct in that view. But I I just think it's a rinsing out of this excess and and where the capital's kind of flowing to. But I think I think the problems with it are because it became what every it started as this grassroots thing, not something where you could launch a memecoin at be a billion dollars and sell everything and just send it to zero. Like that's what that's what Open AI is for. They're where they IPO at a trillion. You know, that that was the antithetical uh o, you know, opposite of crypto beliefs. But Bitcoin's going to be fine. There give it 27 28 something, there's going to be a mega Bitcoin trade again. I'm with you there. >> I like I like that framework. Yeah, I think I think it's going to be a great long. Yeah, the way I think about it, again, I've said this on the show a few times, is that there's this artificial pocket from DATs that were leading to this premium. And now all those DATs are either trading at par or at a discount. None of them at premium. None of them are buying. I don't know if they're going to sell. A couple of them might be small marginal sellers, but really it's just you had to find the equilibrium. And I think you can characterize the last six, eight months as us trying to find that equilibrium again. And at the same time, you have all the altcoin thing going on of of just this cleansing. And yeah, I think it's I think we're gonna Yeah, you know, Bitcoin's not dying anytime soon. I'm not selling my long-term holdings, but yeah, >> guys, that's I have good news separately. That >> that big oak tree in my backyard that I I called up some high school kids. They did it for they did it for 150. >>  >> Wow. >> I love capitalism. >> And they probably had a blast doing it, too. >> Oh, yeah. It was great. It was great. They said it was a Yeah. $4,000 for this, you know, Christmas tree lighting on your oak tree. Yeah. >> Look at you, Tyler. Helping >> uncle call some high school kids. >> You're helping alleviate the youth unemployment issue that uh is is is accelerating four times as fast as the the normal unemployment rate. So, good job, Tyler. Best part about I started talking to these kids and one's like, "Yeah, you know what?" Unsolicited. I was like, you know, you guys looking at colleges? And and they go, you know, no. They were like, they made a rational decision. They were just like, it's egregious. You know, we I'll probably do like a year or two at community college, but I'll probably, you know, I'm going to try and get into like be an electrician or, you know, construction management or, you know, these these things that AI AI can't replace. And I was like, "Okay, >> maybe we got >> I love that. That's sick." Yeah, it was great. It was great. It was great hearing that, you know, maybe this bubble of of college nonsense. I I don't know. We're going to look back on this Lane Keifin hundred million dollar thing and realize that that pricked the bubble of like college sports. And it's I I I as a sports fan and everything that college should have been, it's just it's turned into a big bucket of slop. So when I heard >> the Utah thing though, there's a private equity firm and getting involved with I think it's University of Utah. It just it's it's just >> yeah opportunity to grift is going to get grifted out. Like that's just when things are running like this >> and then you know what happens is we go back to like I'm going to start fishing with my kids or or do doing like really awesome cool stuff >> and this is someone who like basketball like that's how you get a scholarship and you go and you you pay for your education and like this whole prescription of liberal arts nonsense just I think it's just dying and it's so awesome. here. The next generation's not I'm not going to take that $200,000 debt for, you know, where a robot can take my job anymore. It's kind of nice. >> I think that's like if you zoom out the the Bitcoin thing as well is if you zoom out over a 10-year period, what we know is that, you know, are these the conditions that Bitcoin and liquidity driven things should be working? It's like, well, all the buyers of it, the young people are out of job like that it's the worst job market ever. So, so the they're it's not benefiting from this this um wealth trickle down to new distribution to to new age younger age groups which we know has to happen over time. the boomers that are 70 plus owning all the assets that wealth redistribution one way or the other will occur and so I still think that long-term like upward slope p like exists there but you've had also a very bad liquidity environment the RP at zero all these things and the job market for young people horrible so like it's just it's just not like from a high level macro perspective very conducive to it and that's really just po propped it up but there will be a time Because politically there will have to be a time where young people are the favorite group again because they're the future of the longevity of the country. So who knows when it's if it's next year not till 28 29 but it's going to come again. >> Well said fellas. >> Yep. >> All right. I think we can leave it there. But um as usual the beautiful mix of social commentary and market commentary in one. >> Always a pleasure guys. >> Happy holidays. I won't uh I'm I'm won't be seeing you guys. We have kind of tough schedules next few weeks. So, I I I'll be back in Jan. >> Yeah, it might be a little dicey. This this may or may not be the last one with all three of us before the new year. So, we will say happy holidays everybody. >> Happy holidays. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. >> Happy Yeah. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. All that good stuff. Um >> thankful for you bros. You guys make uh every week I learn something and I really enjoy hanging out with you guys. So, >> thanks. >> Yeah. do this again. Yeah. >> The best. >> We'll see you next year. Best hour of my week. All right. See you, boys. >> See you later.
